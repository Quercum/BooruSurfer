Don't know what to do here. There appear to be a simple Danbooru API extension, but I can't figure it out and docs are gone. Chances are that it is not enabled either.
NOTE TO SELF: look into OpenSearch


Shimmie with RSS:
-	http://fairygarden.no-ip.org/shimmie2/ (But XML parsing failed because of unescaped '<3' tag >:| )
-	http://shimmie.4chanhouse.org/index.php?q=/post/list (RSS appears to be sligthly broken, but I think I could make it work nevertheless. Has comments feed)
-	http://www.dollbooru.org/ (More broken RSS, but has extra info.)
-	http://rule34.paheal.net/ (Has comments feed)
-	http://angelhq.net/ (More invaild XML, this time incorrect placement of XML declaration. Should be easy to fix. No direct link, but it is easy to calculate)

RSS image feed surplies following information for each post:
-	ID
-	upload date
-	tags
-	thumbnail link
-	direct image link
-	image dimentions and size (sometimes)
-	author
The RSS feed works on searches too and most importantly, it can be iterated. There is no post count however, so pagenavigation and caching will need to take this in account. A more advanced algorithm for updating the cache will be required.
Tag type and count will not be available, but once calculating of related tags based on cache is done, tags should be decent nevertheless.
NEW: Tag count might be parsable from: "/tags/popularity"


Gelbooru 0.1.x: 
http://booru.org/top
http://lolibooru.com/
Nothing to do here, AFAIK : \
The booru.org network is pretty big, but unfortunately most are Gelbooru 0.1.11 boards.

Gelbooru 0.2.x:
-	http://tbib.org/
Pretty good support, but I don't know how to get related tags to work (if possible). Authorisation and editing is untested/unknown.

Danbooru like:
-	http://wakku.to/ (blocked post)
-	http://wildcritters.ws/ (blocked post)
The blocked ones might require login like Danbooru, test it with wakku wakku (because seacats).
